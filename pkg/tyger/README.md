# Tyger

Next generation reactivity.

Tyger is one of the most performant and sophisticated reactive libraries out there. It combines the simplicity and familiriaty of plain old JS in the userspace with advanced reactive algorithms under the hood, defining a whole new programming paradigm.

The library has several applications:

- used as the circulatory system of the Verba Web framework (which is not yet completed ü§≠)
- can be used as a lightweight state management solution for a traditional rendering library like React. Just think of it as of a new MobX with (much) thinner API
- can be used to organize a network of interconnected tasks. For instance, a reactive build system or even a real-time game back-end?
